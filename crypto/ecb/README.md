# ECB vs. CBC demo


The program uses Python 3 and relies on the `cryptography`, and
`pillow` Python packages. If you have the `pip` installer for Python,
you can install these as follows.

```
pip install [--user] pillow
pip install [--user] cryptography
```

Depending on your system, you may need to install these using the
`--user` argument to install the packages for
your local user, or set up a python virtual environment (recommended).
